 This is a supplementary material of an article, "Constructing simple and interpretable network models to predict 
response of Immunotherapy against Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer" by Hozumi et al. 
 The available code works on R, so if you want to try our models, you have to install R to you computer. The dataset is available on cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org). 
 If you want to use the same data as our analysis, go to (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29337640/) for Rivizi cohort, and to  (https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=nsclc_mskcc_2018) for Hellmann cohort.
 You can also use other datasets in cBioPortal for further analysis.
